# Complaints

Introduction
This project dives into consumer complaints to find out what people are saying about different products and how they feel about them. By analyzing the text of these complaints, we aim to uncover connections between products, consumer sentiments, and the companies involved.

Here's what's in our dataset:

Product: The product linked to the complaint.
Complain: The actual complaint text from consumers.
Company: The company being complained about.

# Data Cleanup ðŸ§¹

We cleaned up the data by:

- Removing empty complaints to keep things tidy.
- Renaming columns to make them clearer.

- Breaking down the complaints into individual words for analysis.

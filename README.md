# Complaints

Introduction
This project dives into consumer complaints to find out what people are saying about different products and how they feel about them. By analyzing the text of these complaints, we aim to uncover connections between products, consumer sentiments, and the companies involved.

# Data Overview ðŸ“–

Here's what's in our dataset:

Product: The product linked to the complaint.
Complain: The actual complaint text from consumers.
Company: The company being complained about.

# Data Cleanup ðŸ§¹

We cleaned up the data by:

Removing empty complaints to keep things tidy.
Renaming columns to make them clearer.
Getting rid of common words that don't add much meaning.
Cleaning up the complaint text by removing punctuation and numbers.
Breaking down the complaints into individual words for analysis.

# Analysis

**Finding Joy Words**

**Sentiment Check**

We counted the number of positive and negative words in each complaint to see how people feel about different products.
